The persons directory is already populated with the fan10 files and fan200 files. If the files in one of those directories are deleted, they can be regenerated by the following instructions:

	Run main.py with either '10' or '200' as arguments
		python main.py 10
		python main.py 200

The files will now be restored using the current data which is contained within the database on the CSE server(s)
