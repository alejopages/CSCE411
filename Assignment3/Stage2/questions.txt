STAGE 2
    step b)
        Which columns will be selected for sorting?
            The column selected for sorting when sorting the Message ids are
            the message id columns
        Why:
            Every column can be sorted, but needs to match only the message ids.
            So sorting everything around message ids is all that is needed.
